        <h3>Black-Forest Cake</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        According to one school of thought, the name is derived from the specialty liquor of the Black Forest region, known as Schwarzw√§lder Kirsch(wasser), which is distilled from tart cherries. This is the ingredient that gives the dessert its distinctive cherry pit flavor.
